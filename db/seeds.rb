# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# tay = Artist.create(name: "Taylor Swift")
#
# stay = Song.create(title: "Stay", artist_id: tay.id)
#
# jb = Artist.create(name: "Justin Bieber")
#
# baby = Song.create(title: "Baby", artist_id: jb.id)
